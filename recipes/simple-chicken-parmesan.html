            <li>2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each), halved crosswise</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>½ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

        <h3>Directions:</h3>

        <ol type="1">
            
            <li>To make the tomato sauce: Heat oil and garlic in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until garlic starts to sizzle.</li>
            
            <li>Stir in tomatoes, basil, oregano, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer; cook until sauce slightly thickens and flavors meld, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            
            <li>Cover and keep warm. (Remember, this makes twice the amount of sauce needed, so put aside half for another meal.)</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. 
                Drain and keep warm.</li>
            
            <li>To make the chicken cutlets: Lay chicken pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. 
                Use a mallet or heavy pan to pound chicken to about 1/4-inch thickness.</li>
            
            <li>To make the chicken cutlets: Lay chicken pieces between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. 
                Use a mallet or heavy pan to pound chicken to about 1/4-inch thickness.</li>

            <li>Preheat the oven broiler to high. Place a rack 4 to 5 inches from the heat source.</li>

            <li>Working with one cutlet at a time, dip chicken in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs. 
                Lay breaded cutlets on a wire rack set over a cookie sheet (this step helps breading stay put).</li>

            <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it shimmers.</li>

            <li>Fry breaded cutlets in hot oil until golden brown on each side, about 5 minutes. 
                Wash and dry the wire rack and return to the cookie sheet; place fried cutlets on the clean wire rack.</li>

            <li>Top each cutlet with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Broil until cheese melts and is spotty brown, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Portion pasta onto 4 plates and top each with a chicken cutlet. 
                Spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each cutlet, then sauce pasta as desired. 
                Serve with extra Parmesan at the table.</li>
